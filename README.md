# Visemes-Recognition-ecognition-in-Continuous-Persian-Words-Using-Lip-Reading

ABSTRACT:
The main preference in this paper by comparison with other
researches is given to application of several specifications
together in effect to gait toward creating a suitable system for
dumb and deaf usage. In other words,
word , in this paper,
paper we tried to
recognize visemes (visual phonemes) in different continuous
words, uttered by different males and females, , with different
uttering speed
speed, without using hand-labeled
hand labeled model on lips and
without wasting time on processing
process
unnecessary pixels. In
addition, we use our best effort to have the most usage of pixel
colours. Although most of these specifications cause confusions
confusi ons
in recognition, we believe that it is the time to decrease the
researches about lip reading systems that have different
limitations and just increase recognition
recogniti percentage
age from 99.1%
to 99.3% or from 99.8% to 100% and so on.
on The result of
testing 10 different utterances was 78.3% for locating visemes
in continuous uttered words and 67.1% for visemes recognition.
